EXERCISE #1 -------------------------------------------------------------
This matlab code was generated on 9/5/23 using ChatGPT 3.5 with the prompt: 
"Pretend you are a computational neuroscientist modeling quanta release in the presynaptic terminal of a neuron. There are 10 quanta available for release, and the probability of release for each on is 0.2. Create matlab code to calculate the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 quanta will be released following a binomial distribution. "

% Parameters
num_trials = 10;      % Number of quanta available for release
probability = 0.2;    % Probability of release for each quantum

% Number of quanta to calculate probabilities for (0 to 10)
num_quanta = 0:10;

% Calculate the probabilities using the binomial distribution
probabilities = binopdf(num_quanta, num_trials, probability);

% Display the probabilities
for i = 1:numel(num_quanta)
    fprintf('Probability of %d quanta released: %.4f\n', num_quanta(i), probabilities(i));
end

Probability of 0 quanta released: 0.1074
Probability of 1 quanta released: 0.2684
Probability of 2 quanta released: 0.3020
Probability of 3 quanta released: 0.2013
Probability of 4 quanta released: 0.0881
Probability of 5 quanta released: 0.0264
Probability of 6 quanta released: 0.0055
Probability of 7 quanta released: 0.0008
Probability of 8 quanta released: 0.0001
Probability of 9 quanta released: 0.0000
Probability of 10 quanta released: 0.0000

EXERCISE #2 -------------------------------------------------------------
The probability of getting 8 quanta released if the release probability of each quanta is 0.1 is 0.0002. See below code used to calculate this. 
The probability of getting 8 quanta released if the release probability of each quanta is 0.7 is 0.0618. See below code used to calculate this. 
The highest likelihood to get 8 quanta released is 0.2095 generated from 0.5 release probability, so given the 8 quanta measurement it's most likely that the probability of release is 0.5.

This matlab code was generated on 9/5/23 using ChatGPT 3.5 with the prompts: 
"Pretend you are a computational neuroscientist modeling quanta release in the presynaptic terminal of a neuron. There are 14 quanta available for release, and the probability of release for each on is 0.2. Create matlab code to calculate the probability that 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 quanta will be released following a binomial distribution. "
"edit the code from the last prompt so that it checks release probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1."
"Output the above results in a table"

% Parameters
num_quanta = 14;  % Number of quanta available for release

% Create an array of release probabilities from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.1
release_probabilities = 0:0.1:1;

% Initialize arrays to store data
release_probs = [];
num_quanta_range = 0:num_quanta;
prob_matrix = zeros(length(release_probabilities), num_quanta + 1);

% Loop through release probabilities and calculate probabilities
for i = 1:length(release_probabilities)
    probability = release_probabilities(i);
    % Calculate the probabilities using the binomial distribution
    probabilities = binopdf(num_quanta_range, num_quanta, probability);
    prob_matrix(i, :) = probabilities;
    
    % Store the release probability in the array
    release_probs = [release_probs; probability];
end

% Create a table
T = table(release_probs, prob_matrix);

% Display the table
disp(T);
