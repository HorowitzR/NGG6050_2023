EXERCISE #1
No, the false positive rate is exactly 0.05, so the null hypothesis (the HIV test could indicate positive or negative regardless of infection status) cannot be rejected since p must be less than 0.05. 

The probability of the null hypothesis is equal to the probability of false negatives (0) plus the probability of false positives (0.05) = 0.05. Since the question is asking for the p < 0.05 level, this is not significant because it is equal to 0.05. 

However, it's important to note that for an individual asking about the confidence they can have that a positive test correctly indicates infection, whether the results would be significant or not would depend entirely on the base infection rate of the population. 
If the incidence of the disease in the general population is high, then there will be lots of true positives and comparatively much fewer false positives since only 0.5% od the total population minus the true positives will be false. So, a person taking the test who got a positive result can be sure their result is probably accurate given the large number of true positives and comparatively much smaller number of false positives.
If the incidence of the disease in the general population is low, however, then there will be very few true positives and MORE false positives because 0.05% of the whole population minus the number of true positives will be a greater number than in the previous case since less true positives are being subtracted from the total population. Therefore, there will be more false positives than true positives and a person taking the test who gets a positive result will be very unlikely to have an accurate result. 
This leads us to exercise 2, in which using a frequentist approach to this question reveals the "base rate fallacy": in a high base rate population the test's positive accuracy goes up, but in a low base rate population the test's positive accuracy goes down. Hence, quantifying using a significance cutoff is less meaningful. 

Also, the wording of this question is unclear. It sounds like it's asking if the single data point is significant, and a single data point can't be significant. Consider rewording for future classes. 

EXERCISE #2
The chance of infection given a positive test is:
Infection Rate: 0.1 0.2                 0.3                 0.4                 0.5                 0.6                 0.7                 0.8                 0.9                 1

Below code will generate a graph for easier visualization.

The following matlab code was generated with the help of ChatGPT and then checked for accuracy by me. 
The prompt entered was: "Using Bayes' theorem, write matlab code to calculate the probability that if someone gets a positive test that person is actually infected. The total population is 1000, the false positive rate is 5%, and the base infection rate of the population ranges from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1."

% Define parameters
total_population = 1000;
false_positive_rate = 0.05;
base_infection_rates = 0:0.1:1; % Range from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1

% Initialize an array to store the probabilities
infection_given_positive_test_probabilities = zeros(size(base_infection_rates));

% Calculate probabilities for each base infection rate
for i = 1:length(base_infection_rates)
    base_infection_rate = base_infection_rates(i);
    
    % Calculate the probability of being infected given a positive test using Bayes' theorem
    % P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
    % P(A|B) is the probability of being infected given a positive test
    % P(B|A) is the probability of a positive test given being infected
    % P(A) is the base infection rate
    % P(B) is the overall probability of a positive test
    
    % P(B|A) = 1 - false_positive_rate (complement of false positive rate)
    % P(A) = base_infection_rate
    % P(B) = P(A) * P(B|A) + P(~A) * P(B|~A)
    % P(~A) = 1 - P(A) (complement of base infection rate)
    
    % Calculate P(B|~A)
    p_b_given_not_a = false_positive_rate;
    
    % Calculate P(~A)
    p_not_a = 1 - base_infection_rate;
    
    % Calculate P(B)
    p_b = (base_infection_rate * (1 - false_positive_rate)) + (p_not_a * p_b_given_not_a);
    
    % Calculate P(A|B) using Bayes' theorem
    p_a_given_b = (base_infection_rate * (1 - false_positive_rate)) / p_b;
    
    % Store the result in the array
    infection_given_positive_test_probabilities(i) = p_a_given_b;
end

% Plot the results
