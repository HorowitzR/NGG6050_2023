"Given these paired values for bird wing length (first value) and tail length (second value), please write matlab code to compute the following:

10.4, 7.4
10.8, 7.6
11.1, 7.9
10.2, 7.2
10.3, 7.4
10.2, 7.1
10.7, 7.4
10.5, 7.2
10.8, 7.8
11.2, 7.7
10.6, 7.8
11.4, 8.3

Please plot wing length by tail length and display the pearson's correlation coefficient and 95% confidence intervals on the plot. 

Calculate the coefficient of determination and print it.
Calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient and print it. 

Calculate the standard error of Pearson's correlation coefficient and print it. Calculate the 95% confidence intervals computed from the standard error.

Calculate if the correlation coefficient is significant at the p<0.05 level given a two-tailed test and print the results. 

Calculate the statistical power and sample size needed to reject a null hypothesis of r = 0 when r is greater or equal to 0.5."
