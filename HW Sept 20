Scenario 1:
You would use an unpaired, two sample Mann Whitney test because you are comparing two discrete populations and seeing if the population means differ. 

Scenario 2:
You would use a one sample, skewed distribution sign test because you are testing paired measurements (same subject before/after treatment) and the treatment could have an effect in either direction (improve/worsen aging) or have no effect. 

Scenario 3:
You would use a one sample, skewed distribution sign test because you are testing paired measurements (same subject before/after demo) and the demo could have an effect in either direction (improve/worsen opinion of product) or have no effect. 
A positive result means that the demo resulted in a bigger value, and a bigger score means the people liked the product more, so the developers would hope to have a positive result meaning liking has increased.
