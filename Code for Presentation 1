% Simulate a dataset of 10 points following a normal distribution in the range of 2 to 5.
mean1 = 3.5; % Mean of the distribution
std_dev1 = 0.5; % Standard deviation of the distribution
dataset1 = std_dev1 * randn(10, 1) + mean1;
dataset1 = max(2, min(dataset1, 5)); % Clip the dataset within the range of 2 to 5

% Simulate a dataset of 10 points following a normal distribution in the range of 7 to 10.
mean2 = 8.5; % Mean of the distribution
std_dev2 = 0.5; % Standard deviation of the distribution
dataset2 = std_dev2 * randn(10, 1) + mean2;
dataset2 = max(7, min(dataset2, 10)); % Clip the dataset within the range of 7 to 10
